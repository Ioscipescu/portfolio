    <div class="line"><div class="line-content">Ben is a fourth year computer science and mathematics dual major at Colorado State University. He is incredibly passionate about exploring the intersection of computer science and mathematics, from type theory to cryptography it all fascinates him.</div></div>

    <div class="line"><div class="line-content"></div></div>

    <div class="line"><div class="line-content">During his studies at CSU, Ben has explored a wide range of topics. Within mathematics, he has explored everything: Abstract and Linear Algebra, Combinatorics and Number Theory, Geometry and Real Analysis, even Post-Quantum Cryptography and Information Coding Theory. In Computer Science he has had almost as much breadth, exploring Programming Languages, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Computer Networking, Automata and Computing Theory, Embedded Programming, and Software Engineering.</div></div>

    <div class="line"><div class="line-content"></div></div>

    <div class="line"><div class="line-content">Outside his education, Ben has had the opportunity to work and intern at multiple companies. In high school Ben was the programming captain of his robotics team, the RoboBroncs, where he led a team of 5 programmers and used Java to program the team's robots, placing in the top 10 teams at every regional his senior year and number 18 in their division at the world championship. Right out of high school he worked as an intern at Epsilon Technology Corporation where he worked with LabView, a graphical programming language, to develop a software suite to analyze a piece of measurement hardware and make fine adjustments to it to make it meet the tight tolerances it had. </div></div>

    <div class="line"><div class="line-content"></div></div>

    <div class="line"><div class="line-content">In his second semester at CSU, Ben joined the Honors Department under the role of Student IT where he trained to be the Honors Department's web developer and IT staff. In the Spring of 2023 he took over as the sole web developer in the Honors Department, and has since done numerous large projects including: </div></div>

    <div class="line"><div class="line-content">• Building the new Track 2 application system.</div></div>
    <div class="line"><div class="line-content">• Overhauling the Formal Thesis Portal.</div></div>
    <div class="line"><div class="line-content">• Updating cleaning up the large codebase that has been worked on by at least 6 developers over the course of a decade.</div></div>

    <div class="line"><div class="line-content"></div></div>

    <div class="line"><div class="line-content">In his first summer at CSU, Ben joined Dr. Ewan Davies in the computer science department to do Graph Theory research. His task was to explore a problem called planar graph packing. Graph packing is an extension of the five color theorem where, instead of every vertex of a graph getting a single color asigned to it, every vertex gets a list of n colors and a coloring is attempted to be found for every element in every list of every vertex without using the same element from a given list twice (this is called the pairwise-disjoint coloring of a graph). Ben's job was to effectively brute force graph packings in an attempt to find a possible upper limit for planar graph packing. He started out by running the computations on his personal gaming hardware, but quickly started to run out of computational resources and moved to the computer science department's Falcon HPC Cluster where he worked with high memory nodes. In the end, their approach to attempting to computationally find an upper bound did not yield any results, but they did find that certain graphs that led interesting results for simpler problems were not useful for this particular one.</div></div>

    <div class="line"><div class="line-content">Finally, in the summer of 2025, Ben joined the High Performance Computing division of the Data Science Research Institute of CSU to work on HPC Riviera, the most powerful cluster at CSU. In his time working on HPC Riviera he has written the documentation for it, helped choose hardware and software components for the next iteration of HPC Riviera, and become the devision's leading expert on graphical programming with CUDA. As the next HPC Riviera is rolled out he is continuing to help make decisions on everything from the parallel file system to the actual system specs.</div></div>
